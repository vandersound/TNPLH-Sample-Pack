During COVID-19, many musicians are stuck at home, but I believe it's an opportunity to spend more time making new tracks or enhancing your current skills. That's why I've decided to record and design high-quality and original sounds, suitable for different genres and simple to export into any DAW. As a result of my work, I'm happy to share with you my first sample pack called **There Is No Place Like Home.**

## What's inside?
### In the pack you'll find:
**~150 24-bit 48kHz WAV samples:**
1. ~70 one-shot samples ranging from 808 to chops and FX
2. ~80 loops including leads, melodics, etc.
3. ~50 guitar loops: 

	~30  - electric guitar with separated dry wet versions
  
	~20  - nylon guitar 
4. ~15 piano loops and one-shots
5. ~20 MIDI files for corresponding loops (Piano MIDI includes sustain pedal info as well).

**All samples are embedded with tempo and key information** and organized in a tree-like structure easy to navigate or use in sample managers.

As a bonus, there are several phrases by Donald Trump emphasizing the necessity to comply with quarantine rules.
