# TNPLH-Sample-Pack
Hello, producer! (or any other person, involved in music production)

During COVID-19, many musicians are stuck at home, but I believe it's an opportunity to spend more time making new tracks or enhancing your current skills. That's why I've decided to record and design high-quality and original sounds, suitable for different genres and simple to export into any DAW. As a result of my work, I'm happy to share with you my first sample pack called There's No Place Like Home.
In the pack you'll find:
??? 24-bit 48kHz WAV samples:
1
2
3
4
Also, there are xx MIDI files (Piano MIDI includes sustain pedal info as well.)
All samples are embedded with tempo and key information and organized in a tree-like structure easy to navigate or use in sample managers.
As a bonus, there are several phrases by Donald Trump emphasizing the necessity to comply with quarantine rules.
You can get a taste of the pack by listening to demo here:
All sounds in this pack are royalty-free except for Trump's words (I can't guarantee their free usage).
If you find this pack helpful in your production, I'll appreciate if you send a few dollars by clicking this button:

Stay safe and creative,

Van der Sound
